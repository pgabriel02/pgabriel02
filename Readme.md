# Hi there! 👋


My name is Petre Gabriel and I am 19 years old. I make websites from an early age, I started at the age of 12-13, but I started to do it seriously in the last two years. I know quite well the front-end and back-end part, I can make complex sites from 0 with a modern design. I am in a continuous learning and development, I appreciate any opinion from outsiders. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, watching movies, or playing computer games.
